# PointyBoot

### Goal
This project is inspired from the DI model of SpringBoot project. It does not intend to be exactly same nor is even close to the vastness of that project but tries to implement its core ideas in C# .NET. It focuses on providing DI in below segments of a application code -

- Properties
- Classes or Constructors
- Functions

This library is production ready although I have tried to fix most of the bugs and improve much of its performance. But there is still room for more.

### Run and test
This project is developed in VS2019 so you can use that or any latest version available. Or we can use VS Code editor with .NET developer toolset.

### Status
Works with the primary use-case. Also contains performance tests in TestApp project.

### Based on
Plain C# with Reflection.
